## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects.

## About This Project
ðŸš€ Web & API Development using Laravel and Sanctum Package

This repository showcases my work on a robust web application and API built with Laravel, implementing CRUD functionality for employee management. The primary objectives achieved in this project are outlined below:

1. CRUD Operations for Employees:
Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for employee records.

2. Display First 3 Joining Employees:
Developed functionality to display the details of the first three employees who joined the company.

3. List of Employees on Leave:
Created a feature to showcase the list of employees who have taken a leave at any point in time.

4. Remaining Leave Quota per Employee:
Utilized the Sanctum package to manage user authentication securely.
Calculated and displayed the remaining leave quota for each employee, considering an annual quota of 12 days per year.
The leave details include employee ID, name, and remaining leave days.
Key Technologies Used:

Laravel Framework
Sanctum Package for API Authentication
Eloquent API Resource for efficient data representation
Note:
The implementation adheres to best practices, and the use of Sanctum ensures a secure and reliable authentication mechanism.
Eloquent API Resource is employed to streamline the API responses, enhancing data presentation.
